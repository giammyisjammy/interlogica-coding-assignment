# Admin âš¡

This is the project which was supposed to hold the admin panel.

I planned to leverage two main components

- [react-admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/) has an excellent UI/UX out of the box and felt like it would make me focus on coding the high value bits - i.e. the business logic - instead of getting into the way. I like tools like these. [Why reinvent a (potentially square) wheel when I can stand on the shoulders of giants?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_reuse)
- Some identity provider to handle authentication/authorization. Probably I would have chose [Passport.js](https://www.passportjs.org) because it has official support both on the [Nest.js site](<(https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/passport)>) and [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/authenticating#bring-your-own-database). [Iron session](https://iron-session-example.vercel.app) looked like a valid alternative.

Honestly, I don't think there's much more to talk about. Apart from these high level critical decisions, I felt that pretty much the rest of this app was an exercise of technique. I preferred to dive into some more interesting aspects for this challenge and stopped here.
